Eprime, or more officially E-PrimeÂ® 2.0, is a set of programs by [Psychology
Software Tools, Inc.](https://www.pstnet.com/) used for running psychological
experiments. Data from experiment sessions are saved into two files: 1) a
proprietary binary `.edat2` file, and 2) a plain-text `.txt` file. (File formats
used by Eprime are documented on the site at this URL:
`https://support.pstnet.com/hc/en-us/articles/229354727-INFO-E-Prime-file-extensions-18091`.)
The rprime package provides a set of functions for parsing these `.txt` files
inside R.

This vignette documents how rprime parses an Eprime text file and the changes 
it makes during that process. **See the quick-start vignette for examples of 
how to use this package.**

**Disclaimer**: I write this documentation as someone who has spent little time
creating and designing experiments in Eprime but has spent a lot of time
parsing Eprime text files in R. Therefore, this vignette is not documentation
for Eprime software or its data format. Instead, this vignette just outlines
this package's approach to extracting data from Eprime text files.


## Background

An Eprime `txt` file is a series of **frames**. Each frame is a list of
key-value pairs. Frames are bracketed by special start and stop lines.

Each file begins with a special **Header** frame. The header is set off by the
brackets `*** Header Start***` and `*** Header End***`. The fields in the
header describe the basic settings of the experiment. A header frame looks like
something this (the several-hundred character-long `Clock.Information` line has 
been omitted):

```
*** Header Start ***
VersionPersist: 1
LevelName: Session
LevelName: Block
LevelName: Trial
LevelName: SubTrial
LevelName: LogLevel5
LevelName: LogLevel6
LevelName: LogLevel7
LevelName: LogLevel8
LevelName: LogLevel9
LevelName: LogLevel10
Experiment: SAE_MinimalPairDiscrim
SessionDate: 07-10-2013
SessionTime: 10:46:22
SessionTimeUtc: 3:46:22 PM
Dialect: Yes
Subject: 001

RandomSeed: -261296366
Group: 1
Display.RefreshRate: 60.003
*** Header End ***
```

The other frames in the text file are **LogFrames**. These record data about
the individual procedures or trials are executed during the experiment. The
following lines immediately follow the header from the previous example:

```
	Level: 2
	*** LogFrame Start ***
	Procedure: FamTask
	item1: bear
	item2: chair
	CorrectResponse: bear
	ImageSide: Left
	Duration: 885
	Familiarization: 1
	FamInforcer: 1
	ReinforcerImage: Bicycle1
	Familiarization.Cycle: 1
	Familiarization.Sample: 1
	Running: Familiarization
	FamTarget.RESP:
	Correct: True
	*** LogFrame End ***
```

Trials and procedures can be **nested** inside of higher-order sections of the
experiment. For example, practice trials may be nested inside of a practice
block of an experiment. The level of nesting in the above frame is indicated by
the number of tabs before each line as well as the `Level` line. The only Level
1 frames in an experiment appear to the header frame and the final frame of an
experiment (which largely duplicates the header frame).

Some **special fields** appear in every log-frame. These fields are
`Procedure`, `Running`, `[Running].Sample`, `[Running].Cycle` and `[Running]`
where `[Running]` is the value of the running field. In the previous example,
these were:

```
	Procedure: FamTask
	Familiarization.Cycle: 1
	Familiarization.Sample: 1
	Running: Familiarization
	Familiarization: 1
```

When trials are presented in a random order, the `[Running].Sample` field
records the sequential trial number.


## Strategy

The basic strategy for parsing the Eprime file:

1. Read in the Eprime file. 
2. Create `EprimeFrame` objects.
    a. Extract the frames.
    b. Create key-value pairs inside the frame by splitting text lines at `:` 
       characters.
    c. Add some helpful metadata inside each frame.
    d. Bundle up the key-value pairs into an R `list` object with an added
       `EprimeFrame` class.
3. Bundle the frames from an experiment together inside of a `FrameList`
object.

Each of these steps is handled by some lower level functions. **In practice,
only two high-level functions are necessary to transform from a text file to a
list of `Eprime.Frame objects`: `read_eprime` and `FrameList`.** Here's how
these two functions can be used to get us the header frame from a text file.

```{r}
library("rprime")
eprime_lists <- FrameList(read_eprime("data/MINP_001L00XS1.txt"))
eprime_lists[[1]]
```

### File reading

Lines from the text file are read into R and stored into a character vector.
Here are the first few lines from the example file:

```{r}
exp_lines <- read_eprime("data/MINP_001L00XS1.txt")
head(exp_lines)
```

Some things to note about file reading. By default, the enormous
`Clock.Information` lines are omitted. Also, if the file is not an Eprime
`.txt` file, a **dummy header** is created so that the file may be treated like
any other like Eprime. The user is warned as this happens.

```{r}
bad_lines <- read_eprime("data/not_an_eprime_file.txt")
head(bad_lines)
```

I chose to use a dummy header instead of raising an error so that code which
loads multiple files at once will not fail outright when it encounters a bad
file.


### Chunking

The next step in parsing the file is to extract all the frames. This is
accomplished by pulling out lines of text that fall between a pair of
bracketing lines. When there is no closing bracket, as when an experiment is
aborted, a warning is raised and the partial frame is skipped.

```{r}
# Experiment aborted on trial 3
aborted <- FrameList(read_eprime("data/MP_Block1_001P00XA1.txt"))
```

The low-level function for chunking the lines of text is `extract_chunks`.
During the chunking, some metadata is inserted into the frames as additional
`Key: Value` lines. These fields are:

1. `Eprime.FrameNumber`, the number of the log frame in the file 
2. `Eprime.Basename`, the `basename` of the source file 
3. The header frame also gets the lines `Procedure: Header` and 
   `Running: Header`.

The result of chunking is a list of character vectors. Here's how the second
frame looks after chunking.

```{r}
chunks <- extract_chunks(exp_lines)
chunks[[2]]
```

### Building lists from "Key: Value" strings

The data from each log-frame have been stored as character vector in a list.
Next, we convert each vector of `"Key: Value"` strings into a list of named
elements. `EprimeFrame` carries out this task.

During this stage, the special fields (noted above) are parsed. The original 
form of the special fields is:

```
   Running: [Key]
   [Key]: [Value]
   [Key].Cycle: [Cycle]
   [Key].Sample: [Sample]
```

These `[Key]` values make it harder to merge together data-frames later on,
since each unique `[Key]` gets its own column name. Therefore, we normalize
these fields like so:

1. `[Key]: [Value]` line is deleted and stored in the `Eprime.LevelName` field
   instead as `"[Key]_[Value]"`. 
2. `[Key].Sample` and `[Key].Cycle` are renamed
   to just `Cycle` and `Sample`.

One additional field is added, `Eprime.Level`, to record the depth of nesting
(equal to the number of tabs plus one).

Here is how the second frame appears after this stage of parsing:

```{r}
EprimeFrame(chunks[[2]])
```
